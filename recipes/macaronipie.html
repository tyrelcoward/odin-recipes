<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>2 (16 ounce) packages elbow macaroni</li>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
